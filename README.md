# Some-Visualisations-of-Thesis-Results-
My passion for drainage planning incited me to do my master's thesis in that regard. The purpose was to develop a system for stormwater management using blue, grey, and green infrastructures.  The thesis involved the use of GIS, Linear Programming with Java, and hydrologic techniques to optimize and plan the layout of a storm drainage system as well as the incorporation of SuDS in this system.

This repository contains some of the visualisations of the results from the thesis.
